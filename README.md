I didn't really USE pointers persay. Most of the pointer usage was already implemented into the program, I simply dereferenced them sometimes to access or change the values that the pointers were pointing to. Big example in a lot of declarations of variables. In case 1 when I created the array of characters for the string to be copied, I created it with an asterick to let it be known that this was an array called name of character pointers.

Basically all of the const usage was with the char arrays. When throwing and catching for exceptions however, I was required to catch using a const msg c style character array/string. Was in a bad mood when I found out. I just thought you should know that. The syllabus says that all assignments are autograded so I'm assuming you won't see this but it's odd to ask for a written out explanation of code when you won't even read it. Is it just so we get used to writing README.md's Professor Furuness?

References was briefly used in the parameters of a couple functions to pass the address blajhsagndkjsfmlgvb,. Namely addStudent.

I talked about exceptions earlier, they catch if anything goes awry according to my control flow if statement in each function. in addStudent() it gets thrown in the case that the size exceeds the capacity or equals it.

Control flow was used hand in hand with all exceptions. I also used for loops primarily. There was an opportunity for a while loop but I DIDNT WANT TO!!!
